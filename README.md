# jQuery AJAX Methods

Regardless the layout of the web page, the only purpose of this repository is to work with AJAX, exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page - without reloading the whole page.

The only file I worked is js/script.js, that contains:
* API Key - for Google Maps
* getJSON - for New York Times
* Ajax - for Wikipedia

Click on the link and write the Address to visualize the result.
Attention: Due to the fact we are working with API. Some parts of the page may not upload correctly. "This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS."
            If that is the case is recommended to download the project

Thank you!
