# jQuery AJAX Methods

Regardless the layout of the web page, the only purpose of this repository is to work with AJAX, exchanging data with a server, and updating parts of a web page - without reloading the whole page.

The only file I worked is js/script.js, that contains:
* API Key - for Google Maps
* getJSON - for New York Times
* Ajax - for Wikipedia

Thank you!
